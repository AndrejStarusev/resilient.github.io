                    We partner with organizations across multiple industries to offer no-cost insurance protection to customers and independent contractors based around pre-determined behaviors aimed at meeting corporate objectives.
                    Our human-centered research has informed a process of defining inclusive insurance protection products that offer measurable benefits sustainably.

                <h2>Employers of 1099- Independent Contractors</h2>
                <p>Independent contractors are predicted to make up the majority of the U.S. workforce by 2027. (“Freelancing In America”, UpWork/Freelancers Union, 2017.) Often 1099 workers struggle to supplement their own insurance benefits. Inclusive insurance fills that gap to support workers and employers.</p>
                <p>With ostraa, employers offer inclusive insurance packages at no-cost, in exchange for predetermined units of work which advance corporate objectives. For example, a contractor who works 20 hours a week may receive no-cost life insurance in a relative value to the 20 hours of work.</p>

                <h2>Fintech and Financial Services</h2>
                <p>Working within the U.S. regulatory framework, ostraa has developed life insurance products to wrap around fintech and finserv platforms. ostraa’s inclusive insurance products are priced to be offered at no cost to the consumer while being advantageous to providers by exchanging insurance protections for behaviours that drive key performance indicators.</p>
                <p>For example, when fintech users engage with the product at a certain level, they may receive a predetermined level of insurance protections. Or, when users engage in good financial behaviors with the product, such as paying down debt, they may be rewarded with inclusive insurance.</p>

                <h2>Retail and Services Providers</h2>
                <p>Similar to our model for fintech, ostraa partners with retailers to match insurance rewards with consumer behaviors that advance corporate goals. For example, mobile services providers are able to attract and maintain customers by offering what other providers do not: life insurance protections when customers renew their service contracts.</p>
                <p>Delivered through mobile distribution platforms, ostraa products are designed to open gateways into more expanded insurance products and services and allow us to ultimately build inclusive insurance products for consumers with minimum friction.</p>
