                <h2>From the gig-economy to your phone</h2>
                <p>Companies have always tried to incentivize their customers to be loyal, spend more, and remain in their ecosystem. In increasingly competitive environments, traditional rewards no longer cut it. Innovative solutions that provide customers not only what they want, but also what they desperately need are on the horizon.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Ghana, an insurance reward was used to improve retention of phone customers. In the first year, the churn of the enrolled population was reduced from a relatively stable 15% to less then 1% </li>
                    <li>In China, a multinational corporation used insurance rewards to increase ecosystem engagement. Within a month of launching 13 million people signed up for the benefits</li>
                    <li>In New York City, a taxi company offered insurance rewards to their 1099 drivers for driving a specified number of shifts. The result has been a consistent reduction in churn among the registered drivers and greater engagement with the company</li>
